## OAuth

{{% steps %}}

### Disable AuthKey

OAuth authentication mode is enable if no AuthKey is set in the configuration
for Tailscale provider.

Like:

```yaml {filename="/config/tailnet.yaml"}
tailscale:
  providers:
    default: 
      authKey: ""
      authKeyFile: ""
```

When the proxy starts, it will wait to be authenticated with the Tailscale.

### Go Dashboard

Go to Tailnet Dashboard (example: <http://192.168.1.1:8080>).

### Authenticate

Click on the Proxy that should show "Authentication" status.

>[!TIP]
> Set "Ephemeral" to false in the Tailscale provider to avoid the need of
authentication next time. See [docker Ephemeral label](../../docker/#Tailnetephemeral)
or [Proxy List configuration](../../list/#proxy-list-file-options)
